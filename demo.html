      <h2>
        Basic Implementation
      </h2>
      <h3>
        By combining the AnimationSequence class and CSS3 transition properties,
        it is possible to create smooth transitions between frames of the
        sequence.

        Repeating Animations
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Callbacks for events are useful to make sure other DOM events dont interfere
        with an animating element (IE, It might interfere with other aspects of
        the app if X element moves while Y is still animating). This demo calls
        the animate method upon completing its animation cycle, looping the
        animation indefinitely.

      <h2>
        Pausing and Queuing Animations
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Enqueuing the animations into frameQueue allows multiple animate() methods
        to be invoked and animations executed without interupting the animation.
        The animations will continue to play until all enqueued animations have been
        played. Click add animation to queue several times to see this in action.
